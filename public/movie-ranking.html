<h3>The Lord of The Rings (Trilogy)</h3>
<p>i choose this LOTR movies as my all time fave because of the fact that it consists of medieval, 
    sword fightings, some magics, and the most important of all is that it has a great story and sequels. </p>

<h3>Black Hawk Down</h3>
<p>For me this is the greatest war movie or a.k.a action movie, during my childhood days, 
    i watch this like more than 10x already.</p>

<h3>The Big Bang Theory (TV Series)</h3>
<p>This is the greatest TV series for me, it consists of science, comedy, lovestory and it has many lessons or ideas.</p>
